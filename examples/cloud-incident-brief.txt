Incident Brief: The cloud reliability manager needs a coordinated response for cross-region latency spikes. When the monitoring platform detects sustained latency above 400 ms for more than five minutes, capture the affected services, customer cohorts, and timestamped metrics. The on-call site reliability engineer validates the alert, initiates the incident bridge, and assigns a status scribe. If customer impact exceeds enterprise SLAs or affects regulated workloads, notify the compliance steward and open a severity-one pager. Capacity management analyzes auto-scaling events and requests emergency compute credits if saturation is above 85 percent. Meanwhile, the communications lead drafts customer advisories and queues a proactive status-page update pending approval. Once mitigation stabilizes latency under 200 ms for ten consecutive minutes, convene an executive review for go/no-go, announce resolution, and schedule a post-incident retrospective capturing root cause, follow-up actions, and ownership.
