Retail Brief: The omnichannel operations director needs a streamlined return workflow for premium merchandise. When a return request is submitted, capture the order number, SKU, purchase channel, and stated defect. The customer care associate must verify entitlement against loyalty tier and warranty window before issuing a prepaid label. If the item is classified as fragile or has a serial number, notify the store inventory supervisor to hold a replacement unit and arrange quality inspection. Finance should automatically flag refunds over $750 for managerial review prior to release. Once the item is received, the warehouse auditor inspects the condition, updates salvage disposition, and forwards a summary to finance before the refund is confirmed and the customer receives a satisfaction survey.
