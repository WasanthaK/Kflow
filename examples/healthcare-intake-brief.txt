Intake Brief: The clinic administrator needs a same-day surgical intake process for emergency referrals. When an emergency referral is faxed or uploaded, log the patient demographics, referring physician, insurance status, and urgency classification. The triage nurse validates clinical criteria and assigns a provisional operating-room slot. If the patient has incomplete lab results or missing consent, notify the pre-op coordinator to chase documentation and schedule expedited labs. Insurance verification must determine eligibility and pre-authorization within two hours; escalate unresolved cases to the payer liaison. Once all prerequisites are cleared, alert the surgical lead, confirm anesthesia availability, and send the family liaison the admission checklist while the recovery unit prepares a monitored bed. After surgery, ensure discharge planning captures follow-up appointments and transportation needs before closing the intake case.
