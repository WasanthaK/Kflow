Support Brief: Customer success wants to streamline high-priority incident handling across regions.
When a Priority 1 ticket arrives, capture the customer name, affected product, reported impact, and time detected.
Assign the case to the primary regional support engineer and notify the customer success manager immediately.
If the outage affects more than 100 users or a regulated workload, engage the compliance officer and initiate the major-incident bridge.
Operations must provide a mitigation update every 30 minutes until service is restored.
If mitigation fails after 90 minutes, escalate to the incident commander and schedule an executive status call.
Once the incident commander declares recovery, send a postmortem survey to the customer, archive all bridge chat logs, and wait for the postmortem draft before closing the ticket.
