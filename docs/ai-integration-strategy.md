# AI Integration Strategy for Kflow

## Vision
Kflow evolves from a syntax-driven workflow DSL into an intelligent operations assistant. Artificial intelligence should enable the platform to ingest unstructured requirements (spoken interviews, emails, free-form briefs) and synthesize executable process designs while recommending business process reengineering (BPR) opportunities.

## Guiding Principles
- **Human-in-the-loop**: AI proposes artefacts; analysts review and approve every transformation.
- **Explainability**: Every AI suggestion links back to the source evidence and highlights assumptions.
- **Security & Compliance**: Sensitive conversations and documents must be protected, redacted when necessary, and retained according to policy.
- **Extensibility**: The AI stack should be modular so alternative models or services can be swapped as enterprise requirements evolve.

## Capability Roadmap
1. **Multimodal Requirement Capture**
   - Integrate speech-to-text to transcribe stakeholder interviews in real time.
   - Accept document uploads (PDF, DOCX) and structured channel integrations (email, chat logs).
   - Apply metadata tagging (owner, domain, confidence scores) to captured artefacts.

2. **Contextual Understanding Layer**
   - Fine-tune or prompt large language models (LLMs) to extract actors, intents, data entities, and regulatory obligations from raw input.
   - Build a domain ontology that maps extracted concepts to Kflow primitives (tasks, gateways, events, data objects).
   - Provide conversational clarification loops so analysts can resolve ambiguities directly inside Kflow.

3. **AI-Assisted Flow Synthesis**
   - Generate intermediate representations (IR) directly from AI-extracted requirements.
   - Surface confidence-rated suggestions for Kflow code snippets with inline natural language rationales.
   - Offer “explain diffs” tooling showing how AI-generated flows compare to existing implementations.

4. **Business Process Reengineering Recommendations**
   - Evaluate current-state artefacts against best-practice libraries (e.g., digital consent, e-payments, digital ID).
   - Flag manual touchpoints and propose automation patterns (RPA, APIs, self-service portals).
   - Present future-state journey maps with impact analysis (cost, time, risk) and implementation readiness scores.

5. **Continuous Governance & Feedback**
   - Capture reviewer feedback to reinforce model prompts/fine-tuning datasets.
   - Instrument telemetry that measures adoption, accuracy, and cycle-time reduction.
   - Establish guardrails for responsible AI use (bias monitoring, audit trails, retention policies).

## Implementation Phases
| Phase | Timeline | Focus | Key Deliverables |
|-------|----------|-------|------------------|
| 0. Foundations | Month 0–1 | Select transcription & LLM providers, design secure data pipelines | Architecture diagram, security review, proof-of-concept ingestion | 
| 1. Capture & Transcribe | Month 1–2 | Build audio upload pipeline, transcription dashboard, and document intake workflows | Audio transcription service, metadata tagging service, ingestion APIs |
| 2. Requirement Intelligence | Month 2–4 | Implement NLP extraction, ontology mapping, clarification chat | Extraction microservice, ontology schema, analyst co-pilot UI |
| 3. Flow Generation | Month 4–6 | Translate insights into Kflow IR, generate editable DSL, validate with simulators | AI-to-IR engine, DSL suggestion plugin, regression tests |
| 4. BPR Insights | Month 6–7 | Model baseline vs. target state, integrate best practice templates | BPR rule engine, recommendation reports, ROI dashboards |
| 5. Governance & Scale | Month 7+ | Feedback loops, monitoring, enterprise rollout | Feedback capture system, governance playbook, performance metrics |

> **Current progress:** AI analytics hooks, BPMN export CLI, and an AI-first narrative extractor with OpenAI/Azure providers plus diagnostics tooling are now available in `@kflow/language`, enabling adoption, telemetry capture, and confidence-aware StoryFlow drafts with heuristic fallback.

## Technical Architecture Sketch
- **Ingestion Layer**: APIs for audio, document, and chat sources; queues for asynchronous processing.
- **AI Services**: Managed speech-to-text, hosted LLM with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) referencing domain knowledge base.
- **Knowledge Base**: Vector store + relational metadata catalog storing transcripts, extracted entities, and validated workflows.
- **Workflow Engine**: Existing Kflow compiler and simulator, extended with AI-generated IR ingestion endpoints.
- **Experience Layer**: Analyst console with conversational UI, versioned suggestions, approval workflow, and audit trail.

## Success Metrics
- ≥60% reduction in time to produce first-draft workflows from raw requirements.
- ≥40% of AI suggestions accepted with minimal edits after pilot phase.
- Documented BPR recommendations for every prioritized process within two weeks of ingestion.
- 100% traceability from approved workflow artefacts back to original requirement sources.

## Next Steps
1. Convene cross-functional working group (product, engineering, compliance) to prioritise pilot processes.
2. Build a sandbox environment and run controlled experiments with historical interview recordings.
3. Define data labeling standards to continuously improve extraction accuracy.
4. Update stakeholder roadmap and include training sessions for analysts on AI-assisted tooling.

This strategy positions Kflow to combine rich domain expertise with AI-driven automation, delivering future-proof process design and BPR recommendations at scale.
