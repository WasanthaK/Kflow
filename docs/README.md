## 🎯 Key Concepts

### Dynamic Forwarding
**Definition**: Routing workflow tasks based on runtime form input rather than hardcoded rules.

**Example**:
```kflow
Ask employee for {vacation_details} and {manager}
Route to {manager} for approval
```
Employee selects their manager dynamically → task routes to selected person ✨

**Documents**: All, especially [dynamic-forwarding-summary.md](./dynamic-forwarding-summary.md)

---

### User Field Type
**Definition**: Form field that lets users select people from organization directory.

**Features**:
- Searchable user picker
- Azure AD / Okta / LDAP integration
- Role-based filtering
- Department filtering

**Documents**: [form-designer-brainstorm.md](./form-designer-brainstorm.md), [ai-first-form-design.md](./ai-first-form-design.md)

---

### UserGroup Field Type
**Definition**: Form field that lets users select teams/groups from organization.

**Features**:
- Group picker with member counts
- Department/team browsing
- Distribution list integration
- Multi-select support

**Documents**: [form-designer-brainstorm.md](./form-designer-brainstorm.md), [ai-first-form-design.md](./ai-first-form-design.md)

---

### AI-First Design
**Definition**: Forms are generated by AI based on natural language prompts, not manually built.

**Philosophy**: "AI generates, humans refine"

**Workflow**:
1. Write: "Ask manager to approve expense"
2. AI generates complete form (3 seconds)
3. Human tweaks if needed (optional)
4. Deploy

**Documents**: [ai-first-form-design.md](./ai-first-form-design.md)
